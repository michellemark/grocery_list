# grocery_list
playing around with various ways to do a grocery list for fun and mentoring projects.

For the terminal based grocery list, be sure to have python 3.7+ installed first https://www.python.org/downloads/.  Assuming that running the command python opens a python 3.7+ shell then run the terminal based program with the command:

python terminal_based_grocery_list.py

This program will allow you to continue adding new items to list until you enter q or quit to exit the program.
All additional menu options are not case sensitive and include:

    S Show the grocery list by department
    A to Show the grocery list alphabetically by item names
    W to Write the list to a file, (always by department)
    H or Help will show this menu again
    Q or Quit will end the program
    
For the simple HTML form version, open grocery_list_form.html in a web browser by either double clicking the file or right clicking and choosing to open with an installed browser.
